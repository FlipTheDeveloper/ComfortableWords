## What is a Comfortable Word?
 There are certain words in the english language that are easier to type than others. For instance, "tank" is alot more comfortable to type than "lollipop". The reason being "l", "o", and "p", all fall under your right ring finger's jurisdiction. They account for 88% of the word. Furthermore, there are four instances in "lollipop" where there are subsequient keystrokes that all fall in the same jurisdiction but are different keys l => o, o => l, p => o, o => p. Where in "tank" there are no shared jurisdictions, so you can type that word as fast as you like.

## The Dream
 What if we limited the number of uncomfortable words in our lives? What if our emails, gamertags, usernames, passwords, and every other commonly typed phrase we delt with on a daily basis was a comfortable word? Imaging how much time you will save. The peace it would bring!
